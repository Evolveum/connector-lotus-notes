ConnId Connector for Lotus Notes/Domino
=======================================

This is a **LEGACY** connector. It is no longer supported and there are no plans for further development.
Substantial financial incentive would be needed to resume maintanance of this connector.

**TODO:**

* check https://github.com/OpenNTF/org.openntf.domino or fix Notes.jar dependency.
* cleanup pom. Now it uses old ICF parent poms, it should use connector-parent from evolveum/polygon project.
* cleanup code & tests
* improve logging
* rename package to com.evolveum.polygon.notes
